# Niyantri Coffee - Website Build

This project contains a warm, comforting coffee shop website for Niyantri Coffee. It includes the following pages:

- index.html (Home)
- about.html (About Us)
- menu.html (Menu)
- reservations.html (Reservations)
- contact.html (Contact)
- README.md (this file)

Design notes:
- Tailwind CSS is used for all styling via the CDN (no external CSS files).
- All pages use semantic HTML with proper headings and landmarks.
- Image placeholders use the format src='https://pixabay.com/get/g66853d6a818c0f08c4f3fb2eb2e5d516a537ca6603fdb9c50637e3714722980b6cb260780cf7da7fba0c03bfd7280b7b916d18054ef06c2b78ec6a99a1ba8e00_640.jpg'.
- The site has a warm, cozy theme with a transparent nav overlay and a warm hero section.
- Accessibility: descriptive alt text for images, descriptive link text, and proper semantic structure.

How to run:
- Open any of the .html files in a modern browser. The Tailwind CDN will style the content on the fly.
- You can customize text, menu items, and placeholders directly in the HTML files.
